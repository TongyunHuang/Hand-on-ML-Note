## Types of Machine Learning Systems
### Supervised/Unsupervised Learning
- Supervised Learning: Learn from data with label
- Unsupervised Learning: Learn without teacher(clustering)
- Semisupervised Learning: Start with unsupervised learning, ask for a label, then start supervised
- Reinforcement Learning
  - "Agent" observe the environment, choose action and get "rewords" in return
  - Learn "policy" - the best strategy - by itself, to get the most reward over time

### Batch and Online Learning
- Batch learning: offline learning -> only apply policy it learnt when operating
- Online learning

## - Main Challenges of Machine Learning
- Overfitting: model performs well on the training data, but it does not generalize well
- Underfitting: occurs when your model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data. Main options to fix this problem:
  - Selecting a more powerful model
  - Extract better features.i.e. feature engineering
  - Reduce constraint in the parameters
  
## - Testing and Validating
