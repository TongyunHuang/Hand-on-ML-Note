## 1.MNIST
MNIST dataset: set of 70k small images of digits handwritten by high school studenst. The "Hello World" of ML

SkLearn provide helper function to get popular dataset like MNIST
```
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)
mnist.keys() 
# dict.keys(['data', 'target', 'feature_names', 'DESCR','details','categories','url'])
```
Datasets loaded by sklearn geneally have:
- DESC key for description
- data key containg one row per instance and one column per feature
- target key contains array of labels

-----
## 2.Training a Binary Classifier
First solve the decision problem: is the img the number 5?

Use Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) classifier
```
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
sgd_clf = SGDClassifier(random_state=42)
sgd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train_5)
```

## 3.Performance Measures
### - Measuring Accuracy Using Cross-Validation
- Main Idea: split dataset into n sets and use n-1 for training, 1 for testing iteratively. Count number of correct vs. wrong cases and calculate the accuracy.
- Cons: accuracy is generally not the perferred performance measure for classifiers, especially when you are dealing with skewed datasets

### - Confusion Matrix

### - Precision and Recall

### - Precision / Recall Tradeoff

### - The ROC Curve

## 4.Multiclass Classification
Algorithms handle multiclass directly: (1) Random Forest Classifier (2) Naive Bayes classifier

Binary classifier: (1) Support Vector Machine (2) Linear Classifier

But you can combine several binary classifier to achieve multiclass classification

(1)OvA: one-versus-all
  - A binary classifier for each class
  - Get a decision score and assign to the class with highest score

(2)OvO: one-versus-one
  - distinguish every pair of digits

## 5.Error Analysis
use `matshow()` to display confusion_matirx. Use percentage of wrongness instead od absolute value

## 6.Multilabel Classification
A data has several labels. For example face recognition training data that contains more than one people may contain more than one labels
## 7.Multioutput Classification
